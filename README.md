# Devaway’s technical test

## Requirements

Specifically, they want a website made of two type of pages:

- On one hand, a main page where they can see a list of all the characters with general information about them.
- On the other hand, an individual page where they can see in detail the information of each character, so they can have access to all their data. This page should be able to be shared with a unique link.

Both pages must be able to be visualized from a mobile phone and a computer.

Moreover, and as an optional improvement, the client needs us to implement a search filter by character’s name because there are a lot of characters in the series.

To start with the project, they gave us all the information through their API: [https://rickandmortyapi.com/](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
